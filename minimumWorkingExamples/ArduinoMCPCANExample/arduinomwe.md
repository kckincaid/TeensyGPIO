ArduinoGPIOExample: A barebones code for sending code to MS and receiving broadcast data via CAN, for use with Arduino and MCPCAN libraries instead of Teensy and FlexCAN library. Some changes are necessary as well as extra definitions for controlling the MCP2515.

This example has not been tested as thoroughly as the Teensy counterpart, as I have migrated from an Arduino to Teensy.
